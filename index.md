## Hello World

<img src="me.jpeg" alt="Me" width="300"/>

I'm Yamaç, a MSc Computer Science student at **TU Berlin**, originally from **Bursa, Türkiye**, and currently based in **Berlin**. 

I love tackling challenging questions, exploring innovative ideas, and simplifying complex concepts into practical solutions, which's why I probably found my way into the world of AI and software development.

Below, you can find more about my background, projects, and interests.

## Career as a Software Developer

Currently, as a working student at **SAP AI Core**, I contribute to innovative software projects using technologies like LangChain, Docker, and Kubernetes. Before that, I worked at **SAP MDI** and **Scandio GmbH** as a working student with similar responsibilities.

## Machine Learning & Beyond

While I engage in practical applications of LLMs and ML as needed, my real passion lies in the theory, for example, understanding:
* how algorithms are structured,
* why certain models outperform others, and
* the elegant math that holds everything together.

This is why I'm always on the lookout for new papers, courses, and projects that inspire me to explore the foundations of machine learning.

## Blog & Writing

Writing is where I try to explain my thoughts — sometimes more to myself than to others! On Medium, I’ve shared over 50 articles, often focusing on theory-driven perspectives in AI, algorithms, and math. It’s not about simplifying everything but finding clarity in the complexity. Check out my latest blog posts on Medium:

- **[Memory in Various Contexts](https://medium.com/the-quantastic-journal/weirdest-explanation-of-memory-727147f14ac9)**  
- **[Game Theory for Dummies](https://pub.aimind.so/game-theory-for-dummies-433bc319f7e5)**  
- **[Statistical Tests Simplified](https://yamaceay.medium.com/statistical-tests-simplified-100bf655f482)**  

For more, visit my full Medium profile [here](https://medium.com/@yamaceay). Always happy to see new supporters! 

In fact, writing is a great way for me to dump my knowledge that I freshly acquired during my studies.

## Education

During my studies, I've had the opportunity to explore a wide range of topics in computer science, later specializing in AI and machine learning. Here are some of the courses I've taken:

**MSc in Computer Science – TU Berlin (04/2024 - Ongoing)**
- **Automatic Image Analysis**: Computer vision starting from the pure basics such as Hough Transform and ending with the latest deep learning models. *Grade: 1.3*
- **Machine Learning in Neuroscience**: Exploring the intersection of AI and neuroscience, such as brain-computer interfaces, neuroimaging and encoder-decoder architectures. *Grade: 1.0*

**BSc in Computer Science – TU Berlin (11/2020 - 07/2024)**
- **Bachelor Thesis: AlphaZero vs. MCTS: A Study on AI-based Game Strategy in Gomoku**: A comparative study on the performance of several AlphaZero variants and MCTS in Gomoku. *Grade: 1.3*
- **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**: Covering the theoretical foundations with a special focus on reinforcement learning. *Grade: 1.3*
- **Agent Technologies: Foundations and Applications**: Course on multi-agent systems, game theory, and strategic decision-making. *Grade: 1.3*
- **Information Systems and Data Analysis** *Grade: 1.0*
- **Stochastics for Computer Science** *Grade: 1.0*
- **Analysis I and Linear Algebra for Engineering Sciences** *Grade: 1.0*
- **Analysis II for Engineering Sciences** *Grade: 1.7*

But my academic journey started long before university. I was fascinated by the world of mathematics, and I spent countless hours reading books, solving problems, and exploring new concepts.

## Featured Projects 

Here are some of the AI-related projects I've worked on - nothing too polished, but they reflect my curiosity and my habit of diving deep into complex topics:

- **[AlphaZero vs. MCTS: AI-based Game Strategy in Gomoku](https://github.com/yamaceay/gomoku)**  
  The source code for my Bachelor's thesis, which deals with AI strategies in Gomoku by comparing **AlphaZero** and **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)**. The project contains both theoretical and implementation details, and offers a playable AI-powered Gomoku game. See [README.md](https://github.com/yamaceay/gomoku/blob/master/README.md) for more details.
 
- **[VecDB: Local Weaviate](https://github.com/yamaceay/vecDB)**  
  A lightweight, local vector database that uses SQL and vector embeddings for advanced data queries. It mirrors the functionality of Weaviate v3, and it’s great for handling text data with Sentence Transformers and OpenAI models.

- **[NQDM: Extended TQDM for Multi-Iteration](https://github.com/yamaceay/NQDM)**  
  NQDM is a tool I built to simplify working with multiple loops. It compresses nested loops into one, making the process more efficient, especially for AI projects where many hyperparameter combinations need to be tested.

If you want to see more of my projects, you can check out my GitHub profile [here](https://www.github.com/yamaceay).

I’m also active on Kaggle, where I share datasets, notebooks, and insights, working on challenges that push my data analysis skills to the next level. You can find my Kaggle profile [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay).

During the projects, most of the time, I had to learn new tools and programming languages, in order to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in AI and software development.

## Skills  

Here’s a snapshot of my most favourite technical skills:

- **Programming Languages**: Go, Python, TypeScript, Bash  
- **AI & ML Tools**: LangChain, HuggingFace, PyTorch
- **Visualization**: Manim, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Development**: Flask, React, Node.js
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes

The list is always evolving, but these are the tools I'm most comfortable with at the moment.

I’m always open to chatting about AI theory, projects, or anything in between. Feel free to reach out:
